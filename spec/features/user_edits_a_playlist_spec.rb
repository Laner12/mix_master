# As a user
# Given that a playlist and songs exist in the database
# When I visit that playlist's show page
# And I click on "Edit"
# And I enter a new playlist name
# And I select an additional song
# And I uncheck an existing song
# And I click on "Update Playlist"
# Then I should see the playlist's updated name
# And I should see the name of the newly added song
# And I should not see the name of the removed song
